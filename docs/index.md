# BlogWrite project
Originally started as a C#/WPF port of a blog editing (web publishing) client called "BlogWrite" developed in Delphi language. Currently, there are two apps called "[FeedDesk](https://torum.github.io/BlogWrite/FeedDesk/)" and "[BlogDesk](https://torum.github.io/BlogWrite/BlogDesk/)" developed in C#/WinUI3 and both share some the same core source code.
